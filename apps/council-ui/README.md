# council-ui üèõÔ∏è

Council-ui is a reference frontend for DAOs built using the council framework using NextJS.

## Principles

This project tried to be as **un-opinionated** as possible, only picking popular libraries as dependencies, to encourage forking. Another founding principal for this project is to **minimize reliance on centralized servers**, meaning all data is loaded dynamically. Data fetching in the application could be optimized using an indexer or static data.

## Features

## Production

This repository is pre-configured to be deployed using GitHub pages using a [custom action](). Furthermore, we've included some additional actions for CI code [linting]() and [formatting]90.

If you need a custom deployment you can build the bundle using the following commands. This project decided not to use any SSR for production deployments to minimize the reliance on centralized servers.

### Build and export the bundle

```bash
yarn workspace council-ui build

yarn workspace council-ui export
```

The production bundle can be viewed at `/out`.
