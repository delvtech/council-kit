In roughly five days I will be able to pass votes by myself with no further approval because the current quroum threshold on the GSC is one. I believe that no one person should be able to govern the GSC by themselves, and thus I am proposing to effectively lock the GSC until two other delegates join the GSC. Three was chosen as a starting point for one reason, to break a tie. As more delegates join, I'm sure this value will gradually increase but for the time being, a threshold of three will be adequate to ensure some level of participation.",
